# Cleaning-and-Analysis-Test-Project

In this project we will work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.
The goal is to determine if there was a specific reason or dissatisfaction that lead the employees that worked for a short or long time to resign.

Information about the datasets can be found in the following links.

Training and Employment (DETE) Dataset: (https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey)

Technical and Further Education (TAFE) Dataset: We were able to put our hands in the dataset but unfortunately it is not available anymore.
